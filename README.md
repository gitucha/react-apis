## Rick and Morty app

This is a simple project where we weere supposed to create an interactive webpage using the rick and morty api to:
1. Display character images
2. Be able to delete characters of choice
3. Use react router dom to route to character details when more information about a character is needed
4. A search bar that will be able to filter characters
5. A loader to handle delays from the API

## Key take-aways from the project

1. I was able to learn dynamic rendering i.e routing using react router DOM
2. I was able to learn how to fetch data using useEffect
3. I was able to learn simple and key delete and search functionalities.
